This is my attempt to use Java to create a web game called Viral Verse.  
Viral Verse is a game where a user is given the first line of a story.
The story is continued with another line written by the user.  Then, another
user can add to the story, the catch is they only get to read the previous line.

This iteration is a very rough prototype and eventually the intention is to create
a web applet.
